# Master Advanced Sass

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [Ruby]()
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Setup

To set up the template, first download this repo with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IamManchanda/master-advanced-sass master-advanced-sass
```

Then open the folder in your command line:

```bash
cd master-advanced-sass
```

Finally, run `sass scss:css --style expanded --watch` to run Sass and watch the changes.

Please note that this doesn't include a server, I recommend `lite-server` for these type of purposes.
